# Genomic DNA preparation from Mouse Tail 1
1. Cut a tail (about 0.5 cm)
1. Digest a tail in an Eppendorf tube filled with 500 ul of lysis buffer at 55 C overnight

### Lysis Buffer (store at RT)
| --     | --             |
| ------ | -------------- |
| 100 mM | Tris-HCl (8.5) |
| 5 mM   | EDTA           |
| 0.2%   | SDS            |
| 200 mM | NaCl           |

- Add 1/100 vol of Protenase K stock solution (20 mg/ml in DW: store at -20 °C ) to Lysis Buffer just before use.
- You can also store the mixed solution at -20 °C but you should avoid repeat of freeze-thaw cycle.


3. Mix well by inverting a tube.
3.  cfg (13,300 rpm x 5 min)
3.  Transfer 250 µl of the lysate into a fresh Eppendorf tube filled with 500 µl of EtOH. (Keep the remaining 250 µl at 4 °C for backup.)
3. Mix by inverting a tube.
3. cfg (13,300 rpm x 5 min)
3. Rinse the pellet with 70% EtOH.
3. cfg (13,300 rpm x 5 min)
3. Dry briefly (eg. 5 min).
3. Add 80 µl of TE
3. Detach the pellet from the wall.
3. Incubate at 55 °C overnight and mix well by tapping to resolve DNA.
